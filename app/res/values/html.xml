		    <p>Currently this app only gives notifications for what the free app of the day is in the US.</p>
		    <p>I have been working on adding an option to read what the UK free app of the day is. One problem I am facing right now though is 
		    where to pull the data for UK\'s free app of the day from.</p>
		    
		    <p>Right now the free app info for the US is pulled from this page...<br/>
		    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011">http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011</a></p>
		    
		    <p>Problem is that amazon has not seem to have implemented the appstore into the UK domain <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">amazon.co.uk</a>.
		    Until I can do a search for apps on the amazon UK domain, I don\'t yet have a solid way to pull info for the free 
		    app of the day in the UK.</p>
		    
		    <p>If you know somewhere where I can look up what the free app of the day is in the UK outside of the appstore app let me know by sending me 
		    an email at skylark95atc@gmail.com or submitting an enhancement at <a href="https://github.com/Skylark95/Amazon-App-Notifier/issues/">my page on GitHub</a> 
		    with the details.</p>
		    
		    <p>Many users have been requesting this feature and I would like to get it added</p>
		    
		    Thanks!<br/>
